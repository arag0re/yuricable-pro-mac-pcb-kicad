## YuriCable PCB KiCAD

### ToDo's
* add solder pads for the 8 lines that the cable has
* connect solderpads to corresponding pin on the Flipper Zero
* add small SWD Socket for debugging the Flipper Zero with a J-Link (needs JTAG-to-SWD Adapter from Adafruit)
* maybe status led or something for IDBUS-Pins
* maybe add solderpad for USB-A-Cable to maybe use the YuriCable for Jailbreak and more
